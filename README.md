Introduction:

> Create a simple Rest API (CRUD) using mojolicious lite as framework and DBIx Class integration.
> Use Carton (Perl Package Manager) to a more organized compilation of cpan modules dependencies.

How to run:
> Install Carton first. Ensure you've 'cpanm' installed already.
    command: cpanm Carton
> After installing Carton, run this command:  
    command: carton install
    *This command will install all the cpan modules (including its dependencies) inside the 'cpanfile' file.
> The 'cpanfile' file is the list of cpan modules required before running this app.
